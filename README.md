# lca_graphic

## Submitter
lca_graphic results from the union of the dataviz experience of Florent Blondin, 10 years on triing to crack the LCA datavizualisation challenge and the coding skills of TÃ©o Lavisse, young and brilliant lca researcher at University of Grenoble.

## Description 
lca_graphic offers efficient charts for the daily life of a LCA practitionners in a single Brightway function to get a first overview of your LCA results.

The [utils.py](https://github.com/teolvs/lca_graphic/blob/main/utils.py) file gives useful tool for quickly LCA computations and analyse of the contributions.
The [dashboards.py](https://github.com/teolvs/lca_graphic/blob/main/dashboards.py) provides the methods to gather all the results into three dashboards :
1. ```compare``` to compare LCA results in different impact categories on the one hand,
2. ```impact_transfer``` to plot the variations of the contribution of the top processes (for the reference method) for each impact category to identify the impact transfers,
3. ```hotspots``` to analyze the contributions of each activity in different impact categories on the other hand.

All these methods are generated all at once in the method ```lca_graphic```


## Installation
Data used come from the open [US EEIO table](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO), and [available here (115MB download)](https://files.brightway.dev/visualization_example_data.zip). 
Note: any brightway2 LCA database may be used and would work.

The code to create the example data and how use the main methods is given in the notebook ``visualization_contest.ipynb``. To see the dashboards, the code should be executed on an Jupyter Notebook, since it does not appear on Github.

## Contribution
Do not hesitate to contribute to the improvements of this project.
A major improvement would be to adapt the functions to Ecoinvent. This would be easily done by updating the nomenclature of the activities and the methods
